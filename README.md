# Chat App

## Running the App

```
npm i && npm start
```

## Tech Stack

Technologies I used to build this chat app:

- React - for rendering UI
- Next.js - to set up a basic SSR React app
- TypeScript - for type safety
- Styled Components - for styling
- Normalize.css - to initialise styles
- Jest - for testing

## Improvements

Improvements I would make with more time:

- Unit tests - with Jest, React Testing Library (I wrote a couple to start with)
- End to end tests - with Cypress, to test overall functionally
- Better, responsive styling - so the app renders nicely on smaller screens
- More features - editing and deleting messages, starting new conversations
- Accessibility audit - full review of accessibility using automated tools
